- **Get:** Complete table implementation with GoA components and interaction patterns
- **Result:** Consistent user experience with other government services

**Scenario:** Designer planning information architecture  
- **Ask:** *"What GoA components should I use to display user application status and history?"*
- **Get:** Card layouts, status indicators, timeline patterns, and navigation recommendations
- **Value:** Informed design decisions using proven patterns

### **Design-to-Code Conversion**

**Scenario:** Developer receiving Figma designs from design team
- **Ask:** *"Convert this dashboard mockup to React using GoA components"* (attach Figma export)
- **Get:** Production-ready code that matches design using proper components and tokens
- **Efficiency:** Eliminates guesswork in component selection and implementation

### **Component Usage Questions**

**Scenario:** Developer unsure about component selection
- **Ask:** *"I need to show application status - should I use badges, callouts, or something else?"*
- **Get:** Component recommendations with usage examples and accessibility considerations
- **Impact:** Proper component usage prevents future refactoring

## Design System Team (Maintaining the Design System)

### **Team Knowledge & Consistency**

**Scenario:** Junior design system team member gets component question from product team
- **Ask:** *"How should form validation work with GoaFormItem and when should we show inline vs summary errors?"*
- **Get:** Expert-level response with examples, accessibility requirements, and edge cases
- **Result:** Consistent guidance regardless of who answers

**Scenario:** Multiple team members need to review different projects
- **Ask:** *"Review this checkout flow design for GoA compliance and accessibility"*
- **Get:** Standardized design review with scores, recommendations, and specific issues
- **Benefit:** Consistent review quality across team members

### **Quality Assurance & Standards**

**Scenario:** Design system lead doing governance review
- **Ask:** *"Analyze this project using 15 custom components - what are the risks?"*
- **Get:** Maintenance risk assessment, standards compliance score, specific recommendations
- **Value:** Data-driven decisions about design system adoption

**Scenario:** Accessibility specialist reviewing new patterns
- **Ask:** *"Audit this new component pattern for WCAG 2.2 AA compliance"*
- **Get:** Detailed accessibility checklist, government requirements, priority fixes
- **Impact:** Proactive accessibility compliance before release

### **Design System Adoption**

**Scenario:** Team wants to measure design system usage across projects
- **Ask:** *"What components and patterns are most commonly requested? What gaps exist?"*
- **Get:** Usage analytics, pattern gaps, and recommendations for new components
- **Strategy:** Data-informed roadmap planning

**Scenario:** Product team asks for component that doesn't exist
- **Ask:** *"What existing GoA components could work for a data visualization dashboard?"*
- **Get:** Alternative approaches using existing components vs creating new ones
- **Decision:** Build vs buy analysis for component development

### **Team Onboarding & Education**

**Scenario:** New design system team member joining
- **Ask:** *"Create an onboarding plan for a new developer joining the design system team"*
- **Get:** Customized learning path with phases, exercises, resources, and success criteria
- **Efficiency:** Structured onboarding instead of ad-hoc knowledge transfer

**Scenario:** Training product teams on design system
- **Ask:** *"Generate training materials for frontend developers new to GoA components"*
- **Get:** Framework-specific guidance, common pitfalls, practical exercises
- **Scale:** Enables team education without individual training sessions

### **Issue Diagnosis & Problem Solving**

**Scenario:** Product team reports component behavior issue
- **Ask:** *"Debug this form validation issue - user says error messages aren't appearing correctly"*
- **Get:** Common causes, proper implementation patterns, troubleshooting steps
- **Resolution:** Faster issue resolution with systematic approach

**Scenario:** Multiple teams making similar implementation mistakes
- **Ask:** *"What are the most common anti-patterns in GoA component usage?"*
- **Get:** Systematic analysis of common mistakes and prevention strategies
- **Prevention:** Proactive guidance to prevent recurring issues

### **Documentation & Communication**

**Scenario:** Need to create guidance for complex interaction patterns
- **Ask:** *"Document the pattern for progressive disclosure in government forms with examples"*
- **Get:** Comprehensive pattern documentation with code examples and usage guidelines
- **Output:** Professional documentation that supplements existing resources

**Scenario:** Responding to design system community questions
- **Ask:** *"Explain when to use GoaCallout vs GoaNotificationBanner vs GoaModal for user notifications"*
- **Get:** Clear comparison with use cases, examples, and decision criteria
- **Consistency:** Expert-level responses to community questions
